# school-portfolio

This school portfolio consists of the team logo, Coursera certificate, and user manual. 

The team logo was used to create the team's image or personality. 
The Coursera certificate shows that the user has completed a specific course. 
While the user manual provides a brief introduction about the application, a step-by-step instruction on how to access the application, and other relevant information such as additional features that are available on the application.  

Below is a sneak peek of the application. :)
